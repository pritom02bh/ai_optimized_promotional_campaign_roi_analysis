# Optimizing Promotional Campaigns with LLMs: Enhancing ROI Using Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis

## üìã Project Overview
This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a data-driven framework that optimizes promotional campaigns for an e-commerce platform. By combining customer segmentation, behavioral analysis, and the power of LLMs, the goal is to create personalized marketing strategies that maximize ROI while minimizing costs.
